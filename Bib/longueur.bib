                 information; as a consequence, geometrical properties
                 of real-world objects can only be estimated from the
                 digital data. For continuous straight lines and
                 straight object boundaries, we show the best accuracy
                 that can be reached in the estimation of length (and
                 other properties), in the absence of noise. In the
                 process, we give an analytical expression for the set
                 of continuous pre-images of a digitized straight line
                 segment. That fundamental result has found many
                 applications in analyses of geometrical digitization
                 processes; several of these are indicated, as well as
                 recent extensions of the method to arbitrary objects.",
