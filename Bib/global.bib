                 Author has mainly addressed the problem of 2-D shape
                 description and showed how a MAF (Medial Axis Function)
                 can be effectively used for the purpose. An MAF is
                 generated by locating the corners of intersection of
                 waves, which travel at constant speed in direction
                 normal to contour. MAF has many interesting properties
                 eg. stability, invariance and invertibility. MAF can be
                 used to infer about curvatures of parent contour. It is
                 shown that MAF can be utilized for pattern recognition
                 even in the presence of occlusion. Relation of MAF with
                 psychology and physiology are also indicated. Finally
                 author talks about an experimental system build for
                 getting MAF. On a whole, this paper seems to be a must
                 for understanding concepts of MAF. - RBA 7/94"
