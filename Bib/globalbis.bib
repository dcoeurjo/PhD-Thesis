This paper pro\-poses an extension to these works, which can segment arbitrarily complex image components in any dimension. The geometric model is a digital surface with which an energy is associated. The model grows inside the component to segment by following minimal energy paths. The segmentation result is obtained {\em a posteriori} by examining the energies of the successive model shapes. We validate our approach on several 2D images."
