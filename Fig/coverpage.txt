 ABSTRACT : 

	 In this article, we present a discrete definition of the classical visibility in computational geometry. We present algorithms to compute the set of pixels in a non-convex domain that are visible from a source pixel. Based on these definitions, we define  discrete geodesic paths in discrete domain with obstacles. This allows us to introduce a new geodesic metric in discrete geometry.
