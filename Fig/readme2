This is the LaTeX package for the production of camera-ready copy for
contributions to proceedings volumes and regular edited/contributed
volumes in one-column format, published by Elsevier Science Publishers. 

The package consists of the following two files

- espcrc2.tex, a small sample article
- espcrc2.sty

Extract these files to the harddisk, and copy them to the directories
appropriate for TeX. You can then run espcrc1.tex through LaTeX and
inspect the result. This file can be used as a model for other articles.

If you obtained this file from colleagues or from the net, please
contact the publisher to verify that you have obtained the most recent
version of it.

The document style has been tested by a substantial number of authors
and at present no errors are known. It can be used with LaTeX 2.09 (14
January 1992 or later) and LaTeX2e. For advanced mathematics, we
suggest to combine it with AMS-LaTeX.

Should you have comments or questions (in case of UNCHANGED versions):
please send them to the publisher.

The ASCII table included in this package serves to detect any
transmission errors that might occur when this file is sent with
electronic mail.
